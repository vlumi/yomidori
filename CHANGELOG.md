# Changelog

All notable changes to Yomidori are documented here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Grouped by **marketing version** (a roadmap milestone), then by **build number** within it — the version stays steady while the build climbs each TestFlight upload (see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)). The build heading is just `### build N — <date>`; the version comes from the `## vX.Y.Z` above it.

Each version's top section, **Unreleased (next build)**, collects entries merged to `main` but not yet in a TestFlight build; cutting a release renames it to that build's heading and opens a fresh empty one. Keep that heading immediately followed by its list items (no prose between), so the release script can promote it. A user-facing PR writes its own bullet here.

The `## vX.Y.Z` heading is written by the release lane too, whenever a release cuts a new marketing version — so nothing about a version's heading is hand-set.

**One bullet, one line — no hard wrapping.** Editors soft-wrap and rendered Markdown ignores the line breaks, while hard wraps make an edited entry re-flow into a diff nobody can read. **Order the unreleased list by what a reader notices**, not by merge order, and fold entries that tell one story into one bullet.

## v0.1.0

### Unreleased (next build)

- **A name on a screen.** The app opens to ヨミドリ in night green over the page ground, with its reading and one line in English or Japanese; it exists so the whole lane, from the package to the App Store upload, is exercised before there is anything to read.
