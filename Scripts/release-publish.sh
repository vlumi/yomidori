# Release step 2 (the dirty middle): the interactive + stateful core that can't
# decompose into pure Make steps. Bumps the version/build (with prompts), opens an
# auto-merging PR, and blocks until CI passes and it merges. All the cross-step
# state (new version/build, branch name) lives here, in memory, within this one
# run. The pure steps that follow (tag, distribute) read the result back from the
# merged commit on the release base — so nothing is passed between scripts.
#
# The base is main, or a release/X.Y.x maintenance branch for a patch on a
# shipped version (see release_base in release-lib.sh).
#
# Versioning (project.yml, shared across all app targets):
#   • MARKETING_VERSION — you are always asked, on every release, and blank keeps
#     it. It is shared by every app target, so a version cut on an iOS-only
#     release is the project's version — which is the point: a milestone that
#     only ships to one platform still moved the project on.
#   • CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION — the build number, always bumped on every target.
#
# Usage: release-publish.sh <ios|macos|all>
# On CI failure it stops with the PR left open: no merge, and (since the later
# steps never run) no tag, build, or upload.
