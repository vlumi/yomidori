# Stamp the current git commit into the built app's Info.plist as a custom
# `GitCommitSHA` key, so every build (TestFlight, App Store, local) self-
# identifies the exact source it came from. Wired as a run-script build phase
# in project.yml for both app targets, so it fires on `xcodebuild` AND on an
# Xcode Organizer "Archive" (Apple sets INFOPLIST_PATH / TARGET_BUILD_DIR for us).
#
# It only writes the built product's plist (the bundled copy), never the source
# Info.plist — that one is XcodeGen-owned. A non-git checkout (e.g. a source
# tarball) writes "unknown" rather than failing the build, and a dirty tree gets
# a "-dirty" suffix so a build off uncommitted changes is never mistaken for a
# clean commit.
#
# A repo with no commits yet (fresh `git init`, before the first commit) also
# writes "unknown": `rev-parse HEAD` fails there even though the repo is real,
# which would otherwise break the very first build of a new project.
