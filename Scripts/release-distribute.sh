# Release step 4 (pure): regenerate the project from the checked-out tree, then
# archive, export, and (unless --no-upload) upload each selected platform via the
# existing Scripts/distribute.sh. Reads nothing but its platform argument; builds
# straight from the checked-out release base (main or release/X.Y.x), which is
# the tagged merge commit after the prior step.
#
# Usage: release-distribute.sh <ios|macos|all> [--no-upload|--upload-only] [--require-tag]
#   --no-upload:   archive/export only, skip the ASC upload
#   --upload-only: upload the already-built dist/ package, skip archive/export
#                  (and skip the project regen — there's nothing to rebuild)
#   --require-tag: verify a git tag already exists for project.yml's current
#                  version+build (used by the standalone retry, so you can only
#                  re-distribute a release that was actually tagged).
