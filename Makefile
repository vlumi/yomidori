##@ Release lane
##~ Cut a build: make release — runs preflight → publish → tag → distribute

# The cut is split by concern, one script each, chained here in order:
#   preflight → publish → tag → distribute
# The pure ends (preflight, tag, distribute) re-derive their inputs from git +
# project.yml, so each runs standalone. The dirty middle (publish: version-bump
# prompts + auto-merging PR + CI-wait) is the one stateful script; state crosses
# to the later steps via the merged commit on main, not through Make.
#
# PLATFORM is ios — the only target there will be; the scripts' macos/all scope
# is inherited machinery. UPLOAD=0 stops after export (no ASC upload). The
# steps are a linear dependency chain so they stay ordered even under
# `make -j`. Run from a clean, up-to-date main.
